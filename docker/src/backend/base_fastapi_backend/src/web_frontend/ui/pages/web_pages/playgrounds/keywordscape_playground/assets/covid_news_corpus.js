demographic groups are more at risk than others of getting seriously ill from the new coronavirus , some parts of the country are more vulnerable to being hit hard by this pandemic . in places with more sick people , more people over and fewer hospital beds per person , the health care system could easily be swamped , leaving residents who need hospitalization in even greater danger . to find the areas at the greatest risk of being overwhelmed by a outbreak , we analyzed the centers for disease control and prevention behavioral risk factor surveillance system , a collection of surveys that ask residents about their health , which allowed us to estimate what percentage of residents in a region were at risk due to their age or underlying health conditions . we then used kaiser health news data on the number of hospitals and intensive care unit beds in each county to find the ratio of at - risk residents to beds . by that measure , one of the most vulnerable regions for which we have data is the hilton head island metropolitan area , where about percent of adults are at high risk of becoming seriously ill from and there are approximately high - risk individuals for every icu bed . while the percentage of hilton head residents who are at risk is on the higher end of our data set , it still notably lower than the to percent we saw in several other areas we analyzed . but those regions had more health care facilities to serve those at - risk residents , while the hilton head area has only three hospitals and icu beds . how a shortage of sand could delay coronavirus .",
